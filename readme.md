Development roadmap
-------------------

This extension is meant to support as many cryptocurrencies as possible.

Each currency should be implemented as a connector (e.g. as in (Chrome-Last.fm-Scrobbler)[https://github.com/david-sabata/Chrome-Last.fm-Scrobbler]) in a single javascript file.

An option dialog will allow to activate/disactivate each currency.
