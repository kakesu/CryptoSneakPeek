Crypto Sneak Peek
=================

Google Chrome extension that allows you to quickly see the balance of cryptocurrency addresses mentioned on web pages. This extension is the multi-cryptocurrency extension of [Bitcoin Sneak Peek](https://github.com/steven2358/CryptoSneakPeek).

How to use
----------

1. Install the extension in Google Chrome
2. Go to a website that mentions a cryptocurrency address.
3. You'll see a small info icon next to the address. Click it.

Try it on one of our addresses:
- BTC: 1KLoepWkHVEMksdMCsu7nc5amfTvVb2qvk
- DOGE: D89ZgPjgiAGRoP1wcYBwKgw449txt2hiKP

Development roadmap
-------------------

This extension is meant to support as many cryptocurrencies as possible.

Each currency should be implemented as a connector (e.g. as in [Chrome-Last.fm-Scrobbler](https://github.com/david-sabata/Chrome-Last.fm-Scrobbler)) in a single javascript file.

An option dialog will allow to activate/disactivate each currency.
